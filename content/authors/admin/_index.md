I'm a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying math and computer science.  I do artificial intelligence research advised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/).  My research focuses on probabilistic programming and well-founded AI.

From 2020-2021, I worked full-time as a researcher at the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/).  I'm currently applying for PhD programs.



<!-- My current research focuses on developing new data-driven Monte Carlo algorithms for probabilistic inference in structured models of the world, and on understanding how the mammalian brain may implement algorithms like these.  I previously developed algorithms and a high-level probabilistic programming language that facilitate the implementation of custom inference algorithms for open-universe probabilistic programs. -->
