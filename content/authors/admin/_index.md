I'm a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying math and computer science.  I do artificial intelligence research advised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/).  From 2020-2021, I worked full-time as a researcher at the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/).   My research focuses on probabilistic programming and well-founded AI.
